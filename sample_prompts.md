# 15 Sample Prompts for Testing

## Code Generation Prompts

### 1. Simple Function
```
Write a function to calculate factorial
```

### 2. API Integration
```
Create a REST API endpoint that fetches user data from database and returns JSON response with error handling
```

### 3. Data Processing
```
Build a function that takes an array of objects with name and age properties, filters out people under 18, and sorts by age descending
```

### 4. React Component
```
Make a React component for a todo list with add, delete, and mark complete functionality
```

## Debugging Prompts

### 5. Error Analysis
```
My JavaScript code throws "Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" - help me fix it
```

### 6. Performance Issue
```
This SQL query is running slow on large datasets, can you optimize it?
```

### 7. Logic Bug
```
My sorting algorithm isn't working correctly - it should sort numbers ascending but gives weird results
```

## Code Explanation Prompts

### 8. Complex Algorithm
```
Explain how this recursive function works
```

### 9. Library Usage
```
How does React useEffect hook work and when should I use it?
```

### 10. Architecture Question
```
What's the difference between microservices and monolithic architecture?
```

## Refactoring Prompts

### 11. Code Cleanup
```
Refactor this messy JavaScript function to be more readable and maintainable
```

### 12. Design Pattern
```
Convert this procedural code to use object-oriented principles
```

### 13. Performance Optimization
```
Optimize this Python loop that processes large CSV files
```

## Complex/Multi-step Prompts

### 14. Full Feature Implementation
```
Build a complete user authentication system with login, register, password reset, email verification, and JWT tokens using Node.js and MongoDB
```

### 15. System Design
```
Design and implement a real-time chat application with WebSocket connections, message persistence, user presence indicators, and room-based conversations
```
